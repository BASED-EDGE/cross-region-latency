# cross-region-latency

## goal
compare aws cross region latency 

## what
Lambda reading a single row from  Dynamodb (aka DDB)

ddb has 2 columns
id and data

where data is 350kb of random text generated by https://onlinefiletools.com/generate-random-text-file

### will see (from ec2 in us-west-2) the latency impact of
us-west-2 lambda -> us-east-1 DDB

vs

us-east-1 lambda + ddb

vs

cloudfront (us-east-1 lambda + ddb)


will also spin up us-west-2 lambda + ddb to cover base latency (to see how much more latency is due to cross country call)

## how
terraform (for something to learn) + running Artillery load test against lambda url endpoint (or cloudfront)

# result
Invoking the lambda closer to the ddb directly is the most performant (given the above testing conditions)
